# Interactive Tab Navigation

This project is a simple interactive tab navigation feature created using **Vanilla JavaScript**. It provides users with information about React's popularity, core features, and useful resources by dynamically updating the content when different tabs are clicked. The project demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM and manage content updates dynamically.

## Features
- **Three tabs** that update content when clicked:
  1. **Why React**: Provides reasons why React is popular and widely used.
  2. **Core Features**: Lists some core features of React such as components, state, and hooks.
  3. **Resources**: Shares resources for learning React.

- **Tab Highlighting**: When a tab is clicked, it is highlighted to indicate it's active.
- **Dynamic Content**: Content updates dynamically in response to user interactions.
